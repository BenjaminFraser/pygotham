    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>{{ current_event }}, New York City's annual Python conference, will take
    place from {{ current_event.begins.strftime('%A, %B %d') }} through
    {{ current_event.ends.strftime('%A, %B %d, %Y') }} New York, NY.</p>

    <p>Anyone interested in speaking is encouraged to submit a proposal for
    talks and tutorials. There are no restrictions on topics, but we recommend
    they be of interest to Pythonistas. Talks will fill slots of 25 minutes and
    55 minutes, including time for questions and answers.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Submit?</h2>

    <p>Everyone is encouraged to submit a proposal. We are looking for speakers
    of all different speaking and Python experience levels, from first-timers to
    experienced veterans.</p>

    <p>The audience's experience level will be just as diverse, so feel free to
    cater your talk to a specific experience level.</p>

    <h2>Looking for Ideas?</h2>

    <p>One of the best ways to come up with an idea is to think about something
    you want to learn about. It's a great way to learn about the topic and
    you'll be able to share your experiences with the audience.</p>

    <p>Another great source of topics is challenges you've recently overcome.
    Have you recently ported a library from Python 2 to 3? Perhaps you've
    recently helped your application scale to a greater number of users. Or
    maybe you recently learned how to use a library to simplify your data
    analysis. Experiences like these are usually full of great tips and tricks
    to share.</p>

    <p>Still looking for ideas? Here are some topics from recent
    <a href="http://nycpython.org">NYC Python</a> and
    <a href="http://flask-nyc.org">Flask-NYC</a> events:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Testing</li>
      <li>Performance</li>
      <li>Packaging</li>
      <li>CPython</li>
      <li>Data analysis</li>
      <li>Libraries such as Twisted, asyncio, and scikit-learn</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Submit</h2>

          submission form starting
