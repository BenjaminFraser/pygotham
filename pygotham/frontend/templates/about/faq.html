    <h4>
      I'm speaking at the conference. Will you cover my travel and lodging
      costs?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Sorry, no. While we'd love to provide free travel, lodging, and gokarts to
      everyone that attends the conference, we simply don't have the sponsorship
      required to do so. Want to <a href="/sponsors/prospectus">change that</a>?
    </p>

    <h4>I missed the CFP deadline, can I submit a talk late?</h4>
    <p>We're already full-up on talks, but keep it handy for next year.</p>
